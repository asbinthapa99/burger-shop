 Welcome to the Burger Shop Website! 🍔🎉

Hi We’re a bunch of pals from the COM109 Client-Side Development, Coursework 2 crew, teamed up by our Module Coordinator, and this is our Burger Shop website—a super fun, modern project we cooked up together! I’m Asbin Thapa, and I’ve thrown my heart into this group effort, building it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a sprinkle of jQuery to make it responsive and full of life. Peek at our teamwork over at https://github.com/asbinthapa99/burger-shop.git—pretty cool, right?

Awesome Features

Multiple Pages: Cruise from Home to Menu, Contact, and Order pages without a hitch.
Fully Responsive: Looks delish on desktops, tablets, or phones!
Smooth Animations: CSS transitions and jQuery magic keep things look good and nice
Form Validation: Makes sure your order is spot-on before you send it off.
Accessibility Friendly: Loaded with alt text, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation for everyone.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle: Flip to your fave mode with a quick tap.
Cookie & LocalStorage Support: Remembers your prefs so you’re always good to go.

✨ My contributions :

Being part of this awesome team, I had a blast adding my flair! I whipped up a responsive navbar with Bootstrap, coded a dark mode toggle with JavaScript and LocalStorage, tossed in a cookie consent popup for privacy, and built a validated order form with jQuery and AJAX. My bits make navigating and ordering a breeze—check my commits to see what I brought to the table!
