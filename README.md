Burger Shop Website. 

Welcome to our Burger Shop project  a modern, responsive, and mouth-watering website we built as part of our COM109 Client-Side Development coursework.
We wanted this to be more than just HTML and CSS and it’s interactive, user-friendly, and designed to people who orders burger online.

 Features
 
Multi-Page Layout — Home, Menu, Contact, and Order pages.

Fully Responsive — Looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Smooth Animations — CSS transitions and JavaScript effects for a lively feel.

Form Validation — No messy orders — every input is checked
.
Light/Dark Mode Toggle — Pick your flavor of browsing.

Cookie & LocalStorage Support — Your preferences stay saved.

Accessible Design — ALT text, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.
