🍔 Burger Shop Website

Welcome to our Burger Shop project  a modern, responsive, and mouth-watering website we built as part of our COM109 Client-Side Development coursework.
We wanted this to be more than just HTML and CSS and it’s interactive, user-friendly, and designed to people who orders burger online.
